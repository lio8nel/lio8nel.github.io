      For the past 18 years, I have been contributing in crafting &
      operating SAAS & PAAS services of different flavours & sizes, from
      on-premise to cloud-native solutions and for various domains. I like to make challenging
      things easy to understand, to ship value as a team and to engineer solutions that I'm proud of delivering. 
      Craftsmanship & agile is at the heart of my framework, and I love to share those practices with others.

      I'm currently working at Salesforce as a principal fullstack software engineer, focused on
      building next generation software.
