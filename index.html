              For the past 18 years, I have been contributing in crafting &
              operating SAAS & PAAS services of different flavours & sizes, from
              on-premise to cloud-native solutions and for various domains. I like to make challenging
              things easy to understand, to ship value as a team and to engineer solutions that I'm proud of delivering. 
              Craftsmanship & agile is at the heart of my framework, and I love to share those practices with others. 
              Likely, I'm always happy to throw a coding dojo to showcase TDD or design patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm currently working at Salesforce as a principal fullstack software engineer, focused on
              building the next generation search platform.

                <strong>Salesforce - Principal software engineer</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I've started this journey as a technical leader, leading a fullstack team to develop new features (UI and APIs)
                on top of the search infrastructure. Most of the features where typeahead features (the system guesses suggestions)
                at that time, and I quickly moved on an API strategy project to draft a standard for search UI APIs. Meanwhile, I've also 
                heavily contributed into moving from our legacy frontend stack to web components (Lightning Web Components).
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2020, I was involed into another org at Salesforce that
                was created during covid: work.com. This team's goal was to develop HR
                tools for employees (a little like Workday), and I contributed into writting the initial framework. 
                I was also working with the devops team and contributed to improve our CD towards trunk-based development and continuous delivery.
              </p>
              <p>
                After 2 years in work.com, I moved back to the search organization. My next project was to be the acting architect of
                a project called "search manager", which is basically a configuration based / metadata-driven engine to configure Salesforce's search behaviour.
                The main challenge was to take on an existing code base with a lot of legacy / unstructured layers, and to form a team that could both refactor the existing while delivering new features.
                Today the project has been released (GA) and most of the code was moved to a DDD-structured module.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm today deeply involved in the development of a next-gen search & agent-based UI platform (data-model, backend, APIs and UI).
                This new project involves developing a whole new stack using modern approaches: reactive & async programming with Spring Reactor, 
                declarative & reactive rendering with Web Components & cloud-native deployment with Kubernetes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most of my work is done in Kotlin, Java and JavaScript / TypeScript
                (web components or nodejs). When I can,
                I learn a new programming language or organize coding dojos, to keep my eyes opened on new
                development trends. I'm used to talk, write and lead
                projects overseas with different timezone and countries.

                <strong>Photoweb - Software architect</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                I joined Photoweb to rewrite the photo composing software suite with JavaScript & HTML5.
                The challenge was that all browser vendors where stopping the support of Silverlight, which was the technology
                that was initially chosen to implement Photoweb's software. 
                That was a very challenging project, back in 2013 IE9 was already out there and we had to build with standards, and only standards.
                We were the first among our competitors to release in production a full HTML5 rich interface that was capable of editing and layout photos on a complex
                interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                We basically created a frontend framework on top of AngularJS, and had to deal with its scale problems.
                We did two things: implement a flux-like (actually CQRS-like) state manager and rely on RxJS to handle the user interactions & physics computations.
              </p>
              <p>
                After two years spent on that project, I moved to a Software Architect position. With that role, 
                I had to design and lead mulitple projects for both the e-commerce website and the factory software (Photoweb prints on its own).
                We also started to move to public cloud, and I had the opporutnity to work on deplying a whole Kubernetes stack in Google Cloud Platform.                
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, our teams were working in a codebase that was surrounded by legacy code (business code was implemented in stored procedures). 
                I've inflected a change with the teams to lift up the business logic at the software level using Domain Driven Design, and by leveraging
                async messaging between bounded contexts. So far that pattern helped to solve problems that were complex to solve beforehand, like the 
                oprhan photo-deletion process that went from a Cron-based system to a reactive one.

                <strong>Digimind - Lead Software engineer</strong>
              </p>
              <p>
                Digimind was a small team distributed beetween France and
                Marroco. I had the opportuinty to touch all the layers of their
                software, from the design to deploying it myself in production.
              </p>
              <p>
                My first project was to work on a drag-drop admin for a knowledge management tool. Basically the idea was
                that customers could conceive their own data model, and that admin tool was there to help them defining their model.
                That project went GA, and I was in charge (like everyone in the company) to also operate the software. I've learned a great 
                deal about dealing with production issues, and finding out problems at the OS level.
              </p>
              <p>
                This experience is also one important milestone as a professional, as I've started to learn and practice TDD heavily.
                That was a game changer in the way I write software, and this kind of started my software craftsmanship journey.
              </p>
              <p>
                I then bootstrapped and lead the frontend team to create the next-gen product: &quot;Digimind
                Social&quot; which was a rich interface written in JavaScript
                &amp; baked by a Java backend running on Twitter storm. That was
                a challenging project, on edge-breaking technologies at that
                time.

              <p>
                This was my first experience in the industry. I had many

                fullstack skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                Object Direct was also providing a training service, and I was
                providing courses for frontend development. I also had the
                chance to create an open source project (wiQuery) and got
                support &amp; time from the company to work on it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Among all my missions for this company, the most outstanding one is certainly my experience 
                as a developer in a startup called Drimki. I had the opportunity to work with people involved
                into the development of a JavaScript framework called prototype (that was a kind of jQuery at that time) and
                learned a lot from them about JavaScript and software overall.
